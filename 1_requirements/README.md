# Create Simple Calculator

This calculator program in C helps the user to enter the Operator (+, -, *, or /) and two values. Using those two values and operand, it will perform Arithmetic Operations.For this C calculator program example, we used the Switch case to check which operand is inserted by the user. Next, based on the Operand result will display.It is the same C program that we used in the first example. But this time, we are performing the arithmetic operation directly inside the Switch case blocks.

# Different ways to create a Calculator Program in C
Following are the different ways to write a Calculator Program in the C language.

1. Calculator Program in C using the switch statement.
2. Calculator Program in C using if else if statement.
3. Calculator Program in C using do-while loop and switch statement.
4. Calculator Program in C using function and switch statement.

# Swot Analysis

## STRENGTHS

The strength to calculate the any numbers with diffrent arthmatic functions.

 ## WEAKNESSES

Do not include any other signs rather than this arithmatic functions (+,-,*,/,%).

## OPPORTUNITIES

Using the phycical operators this project is huge valuable in market. 

## THREATS

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.

# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:-
   
1  User should able to view operation list.     	      

2  User should able to select the operation.           	

3  The system sould able perform the given operation.  

4. The system should provide correct result.          

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:-

  User should identify correctly.
